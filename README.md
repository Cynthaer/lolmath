Framework to compare different LoL builds

This is a personal project to help me answer some questions about different builds on Kindred. After my slapped-together R worksheet became unable to keep up with the challenge of comparing an ever-increasing number of different variables in a comprehensible way, I decided to get some Python practice and create a much more robust tool for comparing builds at the same time.
